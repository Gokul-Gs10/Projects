# 🤝 Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Model Training

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Federated Learning** project demonstrates a distributed approach to machine learning where multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging their local data.  
The notebook `Fedearated_Learning.ipynb` implements this privacy-preserving paradigm to enable model training across decentralized datasets while maintaining data confidentiality and compliance with data protection standards.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Implement a **Federated Learning (FL)** workflow where local models are trained on client data and aggregated centrally.
- Ensure **data privacy** by keeping raw data decentralized.
- Evaluate the global model’s performance after multiple rounds of local training and aggregation.

## ⚙️ Methodology
The notebook follows a structured workflow:
1. **Dataset Distribution**
   - Partition a dataset into multiple client subsets to simulate a federated environment.
2. **Local Training**
   - Each client independently trains a local model using its own data.
3. **Model Aggregation**
   - A central server aggregates local model weights (e.g., using **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**).
4. **Global Model Evaluation**
   - Assess the global model’s performance across communication rounds.
5. **Visualization**
   - Plot accuracy and loss progression across training rounds for analysis.

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – Data handling
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – Model building
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Flower (FL)** or **PySyft** – Federated Learning framework
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- **Federated Averaging (FedAvg) Algorithm**
- **Client-Server Communication in FL**
- **Local vs. Global Model Updates**
- **Data Privacy and Security in Distributed ML**
- **Performance Trade-offs in Federated Systems**

## 📊 Dataset
- The project uses a **standard benchmark dataset** (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, or custom tabular data).
- Each client receives a partitioned subset for local training.
- The global model aggregates results without directly accessing any client’s data.

## 📈 Results
- The global model achieves performance comparable to a centrally trained model while preserving data privacy.
- The accuracy improves consistently across federated rounds.
- The notebook includes visualizations of **training accuracy**, **loss trends**, and **aggregation efficiency**.
