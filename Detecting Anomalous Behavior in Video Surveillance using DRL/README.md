# DRL-D14 Deployment

## üß† Project Overview
The **DRL-D14 Deployment** project demonstrates the implementation and deployment of a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** agent for intelligent decision-making in a dynamic environment.  
This notebook (`drl-d14-deployment-2.ipynb`) showcases how DRL models‚Äîparticularly those based on the **Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)** approach‚Äîcan be trained, evaluated, and deployed for real-world applications such as **anomaly detection**, **adaptive control**, or **automated optimization**.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **DDQN-based agent** implementation for stable and efficient policy learning  
- **Environment interaction** with continuous feedback and state-action-reward mechanism  
- **Model training and evaluation** using custom or simulated environments  
- **Deployment-ready workflow** that saves trained models and demonstrates inference on unseen data  
- **Visualization utilities** for performance tracking (rewards, losses, Q-values, etc.)

## üß© Technical Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (depending on configuration)
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Gym**, **OpenAI Baselines** (or similar libraries)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive exploration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/drl-d14-deployment.git
   cd drl-d14-deployment
