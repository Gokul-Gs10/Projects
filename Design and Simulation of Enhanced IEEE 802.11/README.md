# üì° Design and Simulation of Enhanced IEEE 802.11 MAC Protocol with Backoff and DIFS Optimization

## üìò Abstract
This project proposes an enhancement to the **IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol**, focusing on optimizing **Backoff** and **DIFS (Distributed Inter-Frame Spacing)** mechanisms to reduce collisions and improve throughput in wireless networks.  
Traditional MAC protocols rely on static backoff and DIFS intervals for contention resolution, which often introduce unnecessary delays.  

The proposed model introduces **dynamic adjustment of DIFS and backoff values**, enabling the system to adapt to real-time contention levels and varying network conditions.  

Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in collision management, responsiveness, and overall network performance using a **six-node wireless setup**.

## üß© Problem Statement
Wireless networks operating under IEEE 802.11 frequently experience **collision-induced inefficiency** due to simultaneous transmissions.  
Existing methods employ **fixed DIFS and backoff timers**, which can cause high latency and reduced throughput‚Äîespecially in congested environments.

The challenge is to design a **dynamic and adaptive MAC mechanism** that:
- Reduces unnecessary waiting times  
- Minimizes collisions  
- Improves responsiveness and throughput  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Proposed Solution
The **Enhanced MAC Protocol** introduces a dynamic switching mechanism between **Backoff** and **DIFS optimization** phases:

- If **Backoff fails**, the system transitions to **DIFS optimization**.  
- If **Backoff time is greater**, the node remains in the backoff state.  
- If **DIFS adjustment** is more suitable based on contention, the node dynamically adjusts its wait time.  

This mechanism ensures **faster conflict resolution**, **reduced idle time**, and **optimized medium utilization** across nodes.

1. **Protocol Modification** ‚Äî Extend the IEEE 802.11 MAC algorithm to include adaptive Backoff-DIFS decision logic.  
2. **Simulation Setup** ‚Äî Build a 6-node wireless network using **NS2** or **OMNeT++** simulation tools.  
3. **Performance Metrics** ‚Äî Measure key parameters such as **throughput**, **delay**, and **collision rate**.  
4. **Data Collection & Analysis** ‚Äî Compare results with the baseline IEEE 802.11 MAC behavior.  
5. **Validation** ‚Äî Evaluate adaptability under **dynamic network load** conditions.
