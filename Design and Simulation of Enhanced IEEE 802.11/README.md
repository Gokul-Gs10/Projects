Design and Simulation of Enhanced IEEE 802.11 MAC Protocol with Backoff and DIFS Optimization

üìò Abstract

This project proposes an enhancement to the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol, focusing on optimizing Backoff and DIFS (Distributed Inter-Frame Spacing) mechanisms to reduce collisions and improve throughput in wireless networks.
Traditional MAC protocols rely on static backoff and DIFS intervals for contention resolution, which can introduce unnecessary delays.
The proposed model introduces dynamic adjustment of DIFS and backoff values, allowing the system to adapt to current contention levels and network conditions.

Simulation results show significant improvements in collision management, responsiveness, and network performance using a six-node wireless setup.

üß© Problem Statement

Wireless networks using IEEE 802.11 suffer from collision-induced inefficiency due to simultaneous transmissions.
Existing methods rely on fixed DIFS and backoff timers, leading to high latency and reduced throughput in congested environments.

The challenge is to design a dynamic and adaptive MAC mechanism that:

Reduces unnecessary waiting times

Minimizes collisions

Improves responsiveness and throughput

‚öôÔ∏è Proposed Solution

The Enhanced MAC Protocol dynamically switches between Backoff and DIFS optimization phases:

If backoff fails, the system transitions to DIFS optimization.

If backoff time is greater, the node remains in backoff state.

If DIFS is more suitable based on contention, the node dynamically adjusts its wait time.

This mechanism ensures faster conflict resolution and reduced idle time.

üß† Design Overview

The design follows these major steps:
